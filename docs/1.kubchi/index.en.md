# Kubchi (Cloud Platform)

The Kubchi management tool is developed based on Agile management ideas to create a simple tool for managing infrastructures using Kubernetes.

This system consists of three main components:

- Subsystem for managing applications and their resources
- Subsystem for monitoring program execution
- Subsystem for resource monitoring

## Subsystem for Managing Applications and Their Resources

In this subsystem, it is easy to:

- Install various managed packages of ready-made applications.
- Update installed applications.
- Modify the resources of each application.

## Subsystem for Managing Program Execution

One part of the Kubchi software system is a tool that allows monitoring the execution status and performance of programs and packages. In this system, in addition to viewing the logs of each small component or container, you can also view the overall status of each installed package.
