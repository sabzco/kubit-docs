# Sentry Cloud Software (Code Error Tracking)

The **Sentry** platform is a powerful, open-source tool for monitoring and tracking errors and overall performance in web, mobile, and backend applications. This tool identifies various errors, such as exceptions, runtime errors, and unhandled promise rejections, in real-time, and accelerates the process of identifying and resolving performance issues by providing detailed information like stack traces, **release version**, and **user status**. Its key features include replaying **user sessions**, **distributed tracing**, **code profiling**, and integration with development tools like [GitLab](../gitlab/getting-started). Sentry is compatible with a wide range of technologies (React, Node.js, Python, etc.) and helps developers build more stable and reliable applications.
