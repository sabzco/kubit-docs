## Git Repository Management

### Git

**GitLab** uses **Git** as its **version control system**. This allows developers to track changes, collaborate on code, and manage different versions of their projects.

### Repositories

**GitLab** enables the creation of _public_ and _private_ repositories for storing code and other project assets.

### Push and Pull

Users can **push** their changes to a **remote repository** and **pull** changes made by others to apply them to their local system.

## Collaboration and Workflow

### Issues

GitLab provides a powerful tracking system for managing **bugs**, feature requests, and other **tasks**.

### Merge Request

Developers use Merge Requests to propose code changes. This process facilitates **code review** and team collaboration.

### Wiki

GitLab includes a **wiki** feature for creating and sharing project documentation.

### Teams and Groups

GitLab allows users to organize themselves into **teams** and **groups**. This feature significantly aids in project management and **access control**.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Pipeline

GitLabâ€™s CI/CD system allows users to define **automated pipelines** for **building**, **testing**, and **deploying** applications.

### Runner

**Machines** (**processes**) that execute tasks defined in the pipeline are called runners.

### Stages and Jobs

Each pipeline consists of a set of **stages**, with each **stage** containing multiple **jobs**. These **jobs** are executed sequentially by **runners**.

## DevOps and DevSecOps

### DevOps

GitLab is a comprehensive **DevOps platform** that covers all stages of the **software development lifecycle**.

### DevSecOps

By integrating security principles into the **development process**, GitLab helps teams produce and deploy more secure software.
