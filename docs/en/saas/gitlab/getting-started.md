# Getting Started with GitLab

To **create** and **connect** to a new repository, proceed through the software installation page.

![Install App: gitlab-install](../img/gitlab-install.png)

Then, specify the **name** (slug, which will be part of your repositoryâ€™s URL) for your repository.

![Install App: gitlab-spec](../img/gitlab-spec.png)

On this page, you can view the details of your repository. By clicking on the address, you will be redirected to your GitLab panel. You can also access it via git or similar tools.

Then, access your panel via the address and log in with your [Kubit account](../../../account/). (For enhanced security, access to Kubit services is only possible by logging in with a Kubit account.)

You will be greeted with the GitLab homepage. From this section, you can create a new **project** or **group** or upload your project.

If you want to **import** a project from GitHub, you will need an **Access Token**. Refer to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for assistance.
