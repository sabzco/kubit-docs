# Abrafzar Docker Registry (Container Image Storage and Management)

**Docker Registry** is a specialized software for storing, managing, and distributing container images, designed specifically for public or organizational use. This tool enables development and operations teams to maintain and manage their images in a secure, fast, and controlled environment without relying on public registries like Docker Hub.
