# Create User Account and Register

To use any of Kubit's products, you first need a user account. If you have already registered, you can use [login to user account](../login) document. If you have not registered yet, this guide will walk you through the registration process step by step.

## Registration

- First, go to the [registration page](https://auth.kubit.ir/en/register).
- Then, enter your information into the relevant fields and create a strong password according to the provided instructions.

Then, enter the 6-digit code sent to your email or phone number for authentication and to confirm your registration, and click **Submit**.

Finally, after submitting the verification code, your registration process will be completed and your Kubit account will be created.

After this, you will be directed to the form for creating an organization associated with your user account. As mentioned in the explanation of the [concept of an organization](../#organization), to access the panel's features, an organization must be linked to your account. By entering the requested information (organization title and slug), you can create your organization:

At the end, you will be logged into your user account and will have access to the organization panel.

:::info[Creating an Organization in the Panel]
If you choose not to create an organization immediately after registration (by selecting the **Skip** option in the image above), you can still create an organization related to your user account through the Kubit panel. You can access a step-by-step guide for creating an organization in the [Organization creation](../panel#create-organization) document.
