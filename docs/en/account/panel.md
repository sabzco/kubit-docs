## Create Personal Account {#create-organization}

If you previously accessed the panel under another organization and now want to create your personal (Kubit) account, first click on the profile and then select the **Create Your Own Account** option from the opened menu:
![Panel: create personal account](img/create-personal-account.png)

You will be directed to the **Create Account** page. Enter the required user information and click **Register**:

Then, enter the 6-digit code sent to your email or phone number for identity verification and registration confirmation, and click **Submit**:
![Panel: enter confirm code](img/enter-confirm-code-register.png)

Finally, after submitting the verification code, your registration process is complete, and your Kubit account will be created.

After this, you will be directed to the form for creating an organization associated with your account. As mentioned in the [Organization Concept](../..#organization) explanation, to access the panel’s features, an organization associated with the account must exist.
By entering the requested information (organization name and key), you can create your organization:
![Panel: create org after register](img/create-org-after-register.png)

In the end, you will be logged into the panel and gain access to your personal organization panel.

:::info[Creating an Organization in the Panel]
If you choose not to create an organization after registration (by selecting the **Later** option in the image above), you can create an organization associated with your account through the Kubit panel. You can access a step-by-step guide to creating an organization in the [Create Organization](../create-organization) document.
