By entering the required information (organization title and slug), you can create your organization:

Finally, you will be logged into the panel and will have access to your personal organization's panel.

If you chose not to create an organization after registration (by selecting the **Skip** option in the image above), you can still create the organization related to your account through the Kubit panel. You can access the step-by-step guide for creating an organization from the [Create an Organization](../create-organization) document.
