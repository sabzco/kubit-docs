# User Account (Getting Started with Kubit)

To start using Kubit and its services, you first need a user account. For this purpose, you can [register](register) or, if you have already registered, [log in](login) to your account.

Through the user panel, you can manage account information, access services, manage resources, users, permissions, and more. In the rest of this document, we will discuss the details of each feature of the user account and the Kubit panel.

## Basic Concepts

### Organization{#organization}

An organization is a collection of resources, users, and projects, where all system resources and financial and consumption information are defined under that organization, and access to the panel is only possible if an organization exists.

### User Account and Organization

In Kubit, each user can be connected to multiple organizations simultaneously. This means that with a single user account, you can join multiple organizations and manage activities related to each organization.
