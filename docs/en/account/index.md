# User Account

To start working with Kubit and utilizing its services, you first need a user account. For this purpose, you can [register](https://panel.kubit.ir/en/register) or, if you have already registered, [log in](https://panel.kubit.ir/en/login) to your account.

Through the user panel, users can manage account information, access services, manage resources, users, permissions, and more. The details of each feature of the user account and the Kubit panel will be discussed further in this document.

## Basic Concepts

### Organization{#organization}

An organization is a collection of resources, users, and projects, where all system resources and financial and consumption data are defined within that organization. Access to the panel is possible if an organization exists.

### User Account and Organization

In Kubit, each user can be connected to multiple organizations simultaneously. This means that with a single user account, you can join multiple organizations and manage activities related to each organization.
