# Accounting (Expenses and Credits)

In many businesses, **tracking internal expenses** such as purchasing services, consuming cloud resources, or increasing credit is often accompanied by scattered information and a lack of transparency. Additionally, collecting invoices, accurately recording revenues and expenses, calculating taxes, and preparing financial reports are time-consuming and prone to errors. Users are unaware of where their credit is being spent, managers lack a clear picture of spending trends, and without precise reports, financial control becomes a time-consuming and complex task.

**At Kubit, we have designed an integrated internal accounting system to address this challenge.**  
This service automatically and accurately **records and categorizes all users' financial transactions within the Kubit platform**, from wallet top-ups and service usage to detailed tracking and management of expenses for each tool. At any moment, you can see where each unit of credit has been spent and how much cost has been allocated to which project or service.

## Quick Access:

**[Financial Dashboard](dashboard):** A real-time overview of your account's financial status, including credit balance, service usage, estimated time until credit depletion, and quick access to recent invoices.

**[Usage Reports](usage-report):** Displays issued invoices broken down by month, with complete details of expenses for each service and resource, payment status (settled/unsettled), and the ability to download reports in various formats.

**[Credit Management](credit):** Review active credits (cash, gift, payment gateway), percentage consumed, start date, and types of services associated with each credit. Also, the ability to increase credit via payment gateway, gift code, or payment ticket.

**[Financial Report](financial-report):** Advanced analysis of costs and resource usage over custom time periods, with filtering capabilities by service, resource, and project. Includes pie, bar, and line charts for better understanding of financial trends.

**[Calculator](calculator):** A tool for calculating pre-invoices for cloud services before finalizing an order. By selecting the service type and configuring resources (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.), you can obtain an accurate cost estimate.
