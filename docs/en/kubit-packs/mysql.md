# MySQL Database

MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), particularly renowned in web application development and services based on the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python). With support for transactions, foreign keys, replication, and optimized data structures, this system delivers reliable performance for applications with medium to high data volumes. Due to its ease of installation, extensive user community, and diverse management tools, MySQL is a primary choice for developers and DevOps teams in implementing fast and stable data-driven applications.
