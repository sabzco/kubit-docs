# MariaDB Database

MariaDB is a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed as a fork of MySQL, gradually becoming one of its main alternatives. This database offers high compatibility with MySQL while providing features such as advanced storage engines (including Aria and ColumnStore), performance optimization, and better support for distributed architecture. MariaDB performs well in projects requiring reliability, scalability, and high security, and is supported by an active community of developers and organizations.
