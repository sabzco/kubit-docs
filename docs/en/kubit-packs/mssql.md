# MSSQL Database

Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) is a powerful commercial relational database management system developed by Microsoft, widely used in organizations and enterprise infrastructures. This platform provides capabilities such as ACID transactions, high-level security, support for Stored Procedures, data management tools (SSMS), and integration with the Windows ecosystem. MSSQL is particularly suitable for environments requiring analytics, reporting (via SSRS), and bulk data processing (ETL with SSIS), making it an excellent choice for mission-critical projects with high scalability and availability requirements.
