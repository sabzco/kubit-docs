# Redis Database

Redis is an open-source, high-speed in-memory database used for storing structured data in a key-value format. Due to its exceptional speed, support for advanced data types such as lists, sets, and hashes, and features like caching, message queues, and user session management, it is highly popular in web applications and real-time systems. With capabilities for data persistence, clustering, and scalable performance, Redis has become a key tool in modern microservice-based architectures and cloud infrastructures.
