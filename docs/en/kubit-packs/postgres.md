With capabilities like stored functions, advanced indexing, support for JSON and GIS, and scalability in distributed environments, it is highly suitable for a wide range of applications, from small programs to large enterprise systems. PostgreSQL is recognized as one of the most popular choices among developers and infrastructure teams for implementing reliable and flexible databases.
