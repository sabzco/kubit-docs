# MongoDB Database

MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database based on a document-oriented model that stores data in JSON (or BSON) format. This flexible structure allows MongoDB to easily handle semi-structured or unstructured data, making it highly suitable for rapid application development, particularly in microservice-based architectures. MongoDB supports features such as horizontal scalability, replication, advanced indexing, and rich queries, delivering excellent performance in projects with rapidly changing data structures or high read/write volumes.
