# DNS and CDN Service

If you want to launch your website quickly while ensuring top-tier **speed, security, and SEO**, the **Kubit DNS and CDN Service** is your best choice. This integrated service provides all essential infrastructure with just a few clicks. As soon as you register a domain with Kubit, everything is automatically set up for you: **Smart DNS** efficiently directs users to your site, a **powerful CDN** delivers your content at the highest speed from the closest server to your audience, and with the simple installation of an **HTTPS security certificate**, the security of your site's connections is guaranteed. All of this is provided in a unified and user-friendly environment, without the need for complex configurations, resulting in a faster, more secure website fully optimized for growth in search engines.

## Quick Access:

- **[DNS](dns) (Domain Name System):** The first step in launching and optimizing your website; DNS acts like a smart phonebook, converting your website’s domain name into the IP address of the hosting server, ensuring users are directed to your site seamlessly and accurately. Without DNS, no one would know where to find your site!

- **[CDN](cdn) (Content Delivery Network):** A critical component for the rapid and professional growth of any website; the CDN network caches your site’s content on servers located in various geographical locations close to users, resulting in instant page loading, a smooth experience for visitors, and a significant reduction in load on the primary server. If you’re thinking about growth, SEO, and user satisfaction, CDN is a smart choice.

- **[HTTPS](https) (Secure Communication Protocol):** Provides secure communication, especially for websites handling sensitive information; it is the encrypted version of HTTP, ensuring secure communication between the user and your site. When the CDN is properly configured, this security is maintained in the connection between the CDN and the user, ensuring the entire communication path (from user to origin) remains secure and encrypted.
