## Closing a Ticket by the User

If the user's issue has been resolved and no further follow-up is needed from support, the user can change the status of their ticket to **Closed**. This can be done in two ways: the Close Ticket option from the **ticket list** and the Close Ticket button on the **ticket details page**.

### Method 1: Ticket List

To view the Telegram bot settings, select the **Telegram Bot** option from the support page:
![Ticketing: ticketing bot](img/ticketing-bot.png)

- Follow the steps mentioned to add the Telegram bot, [@KubitSupportBot](https://t.me/KubitSupportBot), to your desired Telegram group.
- Then enter the group ID received from the bot in the **Group ID** section and select **Activate**:
