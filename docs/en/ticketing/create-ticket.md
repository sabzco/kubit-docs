# Creating a New Ticket

Two access points have been provided for creating a ticket:

- The **Recent Tickets** section on the panel’s homepage
- The **New Ticket** section on the support service page

:::tip[Mandatory Fields]
All ticket fields except file uploads are mandatory. Ensure your request is described comprehensively and clearly in the ticket to allow the support team to conduct the initial review more quickly and accurately.
