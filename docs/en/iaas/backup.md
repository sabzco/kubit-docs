## Backup

In this section, you can create and manage **backup rules** for virtual machines in the project. Each backup rule takes snapshots of the specified virtual machine **periodically (daily, weekly, or monthly)** and retains them up to a **specified number of versions**.  
Supported operations include **creating a new rule**, **deleting a rule**, and **managing backup versions**.
