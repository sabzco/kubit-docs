# Infrastructure (Cloud Computing)

The Infrastructure Services section of Kubit is responsible for providing cloud computing resources such as processors, memory, disks, and network, based on demand and on a pay-as-you-go basis for the user. In this section, you will be able to create your virtual machines under different projects by selecting the type of operating system, CPU and memory capacity, disk size and number, network settings, and security features such as SSH keys.
